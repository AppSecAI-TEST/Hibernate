<p>A cricket bat is a specialised piece of equipment used by batsmen in the sport of cricket to hit the ball, typically consisting of a cane handle attached to a flat-fronted willow-wood blade. The length of the bat may be no more than 38 inches (965 mm) and the width no more than 4.25 inches (108 mm).
 Its use is first mentioned in 1624. Since 1979, the rule change stipulated that bats can only be made from wood.</p>
 <p>he blade of a cricket bat is a wooden block that is generally flat on the striking face and with a ridge on the 
 reverse (back) which concentrates wood in the middle where the ball is generally hit. The bat is traditionally made
  from willow wood, specifically from a variety of White Willow called Cricket Bat Willow (Salix alba var. caerulea),
   treated with raw (unboiled) linseed oil, which has a protective function. This variety of willow is used as it is
    very tough and shock-resistant, not being significantly dented nor splintering on the impact of a cricket ball at 
    high speed, while also being light in weight. The face of the bat is often covered with a protective film by the 
    user.</p>

<p>A cricket ball is a hard, solid ball used to play cricket. A cricket ball consists of cork covered by leather, and 
manufacture is regulated by cricket law at first-class level. The manipulation of a cricket ball, through employment of 
its various physical properties, is a staple component of bowling and dismissing batsmen. Movement in the air, and off 
the ground, is influenced by the condition of the ball, the efforts of the bowler and the pitch, while working on the
 cricket ball to obtain optimum condition is a key role of the fielding side. The cricket ball is the principal manner 
 through which the batsman scores runs, by manipulating the ball into a position where it would be safe to take a run, 
 or by directing the ball through or over the boundary.</p>
<p>
In Test cricket, professional domestic games that spread over a multitude of days, and almost the entirety of amateur 
cricket, the traditional red cricket ball is normally used. In many one day cricket matches, a white ball is used 
instead in order to remain visible under floodlights, and since 2010, pink has been introduced to contrast with players'
 white clothing and for improved night visibility.[1] Training balls of white, red and pink are also common, and tennis 
 balls and other similar-sized balls can be used for training or informal cricket matches. During cricket matches, the 
 quality of the ball changes to a point where it is no longer usable, and during this decline its properties alter and 
 thus can influence the match. Altering the state of the cricket ball outside the permitted manners designated in the
  rules of cricket is prohibited during a match, and so-called "ball tampering" has resulted in numerous controversies.
Injuries and fatalities have been caused by cricket balls during matches</p>

<p>Leg pads, worn by the two batsmen and the wicket-keeper, used to protect the shin bone against impact from the ball. The wicket-keeping pads are slightly 
different from the batsmen's. Fielders that are fielding in close to the batsmen may wear shin guards (internal) as well.</p>

<p>In cricket, the stumps are the three vertical posts that support the "bails" and form the wicket. Stumping 
or being stumped is a method of dismissing a batsman. The umpire calling stumps means the play is over for the day.</p>
