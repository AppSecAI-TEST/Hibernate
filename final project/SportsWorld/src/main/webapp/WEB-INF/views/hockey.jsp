<p>Field hockey sticks have an end which varies in shape, often depending on the players position. In general there are
 four main variations on head:
The 'shorti' is mainly used by players wishing extreme control over the ball, and increase their maneuverability. This 
specific head is most associated with the mid-field position. (or center for Ice Hockey)

The 'Midi' is used by players who will be hitting the ball often and need to be strong on their 'reverse side'. This 
specific head is most associated with the striker, or 'up-front' position.

The 'Maxi' is similar to the 'Midi' as it has an increased surface area which is useful for hitting. However its 
strength allows it to be used much more effectively for stopping the ball. This head is used by 'defenders' and 'attackers'.</p>

<p>Standard fiels hockey balls are hard spherical balls made of plastic(sometimes over a cork core) and are usually white
although they can be any colour as long as they contrast with the playing surface.The balls have a cirumference
of 224-235mm(8.8-9.3 in) and a mass of 156-163 g(5.5-5,7 oz)</p>

<p>Hockey helmets grip the head from inside by cupping the back of head, or the occipital protuberance. Helmet 
manufacturers will have a chart that relates their helmet sizes to head measurements.
Most helmets have tool-free adjustments, but on older models, the helmet size is adjusted by loosening the screws on 
the side to slide the front portion forward or back.</p>
<p>The shell of a hockey helmet is generally made of a substance called vinyl nitrile that disperses force from the
 point of contact, while the liner may be made of either vinyl nitrile foam, expanded polypropylene foam, or other 
 material to absorb the energy, to reduce the chances of concussion.</p>

 <p>A glove (Middle English from Old English glof) is a garment covering the whole hand. Gloves have separate sheaths 
 or openings for each finger and the thumb; if there is an opening but no (or a short) covering sheath for each finger 
 they are called fingerless gloves. Fingerless gloves having one large opening rather than individual openings for each
  finger are sometimes called gauntlets, though gauntlets are not necessarily fingerless. Gloves which cover the entire
   hand or fist but do not have separate finger openings or sheaths are called mittens. Mittens are warmer than other 
   styles of gloves made of the same material because fingers maintain their warmth better when they are in contact 
   with each other. Reduced surface area reduces heat loss.</p>

 guards for outfield players or, along with the other pads, goalkeeping pads, similar to those in cricket or ice hockey.</p>
