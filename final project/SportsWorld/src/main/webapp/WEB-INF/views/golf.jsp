<p>A player usually carries several clubs during the game (but no more than fourteen, the limit defined by the rules).
 There are three major types of clubs, known as woods, irons, and putters. Woods are played for long shots from the tee 
 or fairway, and occasionally rough, while irons are for precision shots from fairways as well as from the rough. Wedges
  are irons used to play shorter shots. A new type of club called a hybrid combines the straight-hitting characteristics
   of irons with the easy-to-hit characteristics of higher-lofted woods.</p>
   <p> A hybrid is often used for long shots from
    difficult rough. Hybrids are also used by players who have a difficult time getting the ball airborne with long 
    irons. Wedges are played from difficult ground such as sand or the rough and for approach shots to the green. 
    Putters are mostly played on the green, but can also be useful when playing from bunkers or for some approach shots.
     Putters have minimal loft, forcing the ball to stay on the putting surface when struck. The most common clubs to 
     find in a golfer's bag are the driver, 3-wood, numbered irons from 3 to 9 (with hybrids commonly replacing the 3 
     and 4 iron), pitching and sand wedges, and a putter. Players commonly also carry a 5-wood, and/or additional wedges
      such as a gap or lob wedge.</p>

<p>Originally, golf balls were made of a hardwood, such as beech. Beginning between the 14th and 16th centuries, more 
expensive golf balls were made of a leather skin stuffed with down feathers; these were called "featheries". Around the
 mid-1800s, a new material called gutta-percha, made from the latex of the East Asian sapodilla tree, started to be used
  to create more inexpensive golf balls nicknamed "gutties", which had similar flight characteristics as featheries.
   These then progressed to "brambles" in the later 1800s, using a raised dimple pattern and resembling bramble fruit, 
   and then to "meshies" beginning in the early 1900s, where ball manufacturers started experimenting with latex rubber 
   cores and wound mesh skins that created recessed patterns over the ball's surface. </p>

<p>Golfers also often wear gloves that help grip the club and prevent blistering. Gloves are sold individually and 
normally worn only on the players' non-dominant hand, but it is not unheard-of for a player to wear gloves on both
 hands to reduce chafing. The increased grip and control allows for harder swings to be made with more control, 
 increasing distance.</p>

<p>A tee is an object (wooden or plastic) that is pushed into or placed on the ground to rest a ball on top of for an 
easier shot; however, this is only allowed for the first stroke (tee shot or drive) of each hole. Conventional golf 
tees are basically spikes with a small cup on the head to hold the ball, and are usually made of wood or plastic. 
Wooden tees are generally very inexpensive and quite disposable; a player may damage or break many of these during 
the course of a round. </p>
<p>Plastic tees are generally more expensive but last longer. The length of tees varies according to the club intended 
to be used and by personal preference; longer tees (3-3.5") allow the player to position the ball higher off the ground
 while remaining stable when planted, and are generally used for modern deep-faced woods. They can be planted deeper 
 for use with other clubs but then tend to break more often. Shorter tees (1.5-2.5") are suitable for irons and are 
 more easily inserted and less easily broken than long tees. Other designs of tee exist; the "step tee" is milled or
  molded with a spool-shaped upper half, and so generally provides a consistent ball height from shot to shot. The
   "brush tee" uses a collection of stiff bristles instead of a cup to position the ball; the design is touted by its 
   manufacturer as providing less interference to the ball or club at impact, for a straighter, longer flight.</p>

<p>Many golfers wear special shoes. The shoes can be spikeless or with spikes attached to the soles. The spikes can be 
made of metal or plastic (plastic spikes are also known as "soft spikes") designed to increase traction thus helping
 the player to keep his/her balance during the swing, on greens, or in wet conditions. In an attempt to minimize the 
 severity of spike marks made on greens, many golf courses have banned metal spikes, allowing only plastic spikes 
 during play.</p>
 <p>
Spikes on most golf shoes are replaceable, being attached using one of two common methods: a thread or a twist lock.
 Two sizes of thread are in common use, called a "large thread" and "small thread". There are two common locking 
 systems: Q-LOK and Tri-LOK (also called "Fast Twist"). The locking systems use a plastic thread which takes only 
 about a half turn to lock</p>
